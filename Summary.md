# Summary for the 4.1 excel page

First topic is the Ownership of the Info... The obvious owner is the person to whom the data belongs. 
The other system to whom the data could belong is the retail company. This would be a case by case answer, depending on weather the person signed 
a paper that said that they were giving up their data to the retailers and that the retailer can do with the info as they please... This leads me into the 
4th point, namely "Person's permission." If the retailer is selling the info, the company first needs owner-ship of the info and this cannot be done without the person's permission...
i.e. the person has to sign a contract saying that they are in their right mind when they sell their personal data to the retialer.
If the retailers have this signed contract from the person, then they can sell the data legally. Deciding weather they are ethically right in selling the data would require a much more nuanced discussion than this little summary.

Miss-use of the personal info is an ethical quandry that rests on the retail company and the buyer of said company. While they may be able to do the trade legally if they have the 
person's permission, it would be tough to decide weather they are ethical in doing so. Nevertheless, should a problem arise in the ethics of the trade, the two would undoubtedly have to answer to the authorities.

As for the third point: "Right to Privacy," I put it into the person's ethical responsibility. If the person doesn't want his info to be sold to random bulk buyers of data online, 
they must make an effort so that it doesn't happen. This means that they must avoid signing online contracts that let the 
company do whatever they want with their information. While this would mean that they cannot do business with the retail company or some other online scheme, at least their data would be safe.
